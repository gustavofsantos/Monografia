  abstract =	"Learn how to use Solidity and the Ethereum project ---
		 second only to Bitcoin in market capitalization.
		 Blockchain protocols are taking the world by storm, and
		 the Ethereum project, with its Turing-complete
		 scripting language Solidity, has rapidly become a
		 front-runner. This book presents the blockchain
		 phenomenon in context; then situates Ethereum in a
		 world pioneered by Bitcoin. See why professionals and
		 non-professionals alike are honing their skills in
		 smart contract patterns and distributed application
		 development. You'll review the fundamentals of
		 programming and networking, alongside its introduction
		 to the new discipline of crypto-economics. You'll then
		 deploy smart contracts of your own, and learn how they
		 can serve as a back-end for JavaScript and HTML
		 applications on the Web. Many Solidity tutorials out
		 there today have the same flaw: they are written
		 for``advanced'' JavaScript developers who want to
		 transfer their skills to a blockchain environment.
		 Introducing Ethereum and Solidity is accessible to
		 technology professionals and enthusiasts of ``all
		 levels.'' You'll find exciting sample code that can
		 move forward real world assets in both the academic and
		 the corporate arenas. Find out now why this book is a
		 powerful gateway for creative technologists of all
		 types, from concept to deployment.",
